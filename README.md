This is a simple code quiz. The user is presented with code related questions in succession. When the quiz starts a timer for 75 seconds starts as well. When the user answers a question wrong, the timer is deducted by 10 seconds. Once the quiz is finished, the user will be able to view their high score and input their name for a high scoreboard.
